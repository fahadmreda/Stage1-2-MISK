*analysis* of the Diamonds dataset 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r output="asis"  ,echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(jems) %>%
  summarise(n = length(jems),
            Average = mean(weight), 
            SD = sd(weight)) %>% kable()
  

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
